A Pokemon CRUD API build with HonoOpenApi and Scalar

After I saw a clip of Syntax new Video "Build a documented / type-safe API with hono" and had a look on
the [hono-open-api-starter](https://github.com/w3cj/hono-open-api-starter) package and decided to a 
HonoOpenApi Project myself. I also wanted to use this project to test Biome as a replacement for prettier 
for future projects.
